## Introduction

Building API integrations can be difficult. Once you have found the right API client to use, there's often lots of boilerplate configuration to remember and decision fatigue can settle in really quickly. Saloon offers a fresh, fluent framework for building your next API integration or PHP SDK. Saloon's syntax is object-oriented, standardised and easy to understand. You can build one or many API integrations with Saloon, the sky is the limit. If you're using Laravel, there's a dedicated Laravel package with pre-written commands and a more advanced mocking toolbelt. Saloon will help you get up and running with APIs in a matter of minutes, and will scale with your project.

```php
<?php

use App\Http\Saloon\Requests\GetForgeServerRequest;

$request = new GetForgeServerRequest(serverId: '123456');

$response = $request->send();
$data = $response->json();
```
